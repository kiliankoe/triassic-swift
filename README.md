Triassic aims to be a fully-featured client library for TRIAS systems enabling you to access public transport data from compatible providers right from within your mobile app or other service written in Swift.

**All of this is currently very much a work-in-progress and should be considered non-functional at this point. Updates to this README will be made when that state changes.**

The name comes from *Trias* being the German name for the [Triassic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic) geological period.

## Example

## Requirements

[WIP]

## Installation

Triassic is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Triassic"
```

Or via Carthage, if you should so prefer. In that case add the following to your Cartfile:

```
github "triassic-park/triassic-swift"
```

Support for Swift Package Manager should in theory be there as well, but there's still [some quirks](https://github.com/triassic-park/triassic-swift/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aswiftpm) to be worked out.
